                            <p>I am a web developer from Houston, Texas, who fell in love with coding during my first Computer Science class in highschool. I watched in awe as "Hello World!" printed out on the console and haven't looked back since! Ask any of my former collegues I'm known for being a mentor and providing guidance. If there was anything I wanted to be known for, it's the impact I can create on others by sharing my passion for coding!</p>
