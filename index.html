                            <p>I am a web developer from Houston, Texas, who fell in love with coding during my first Computer Science class in highschool. I watched in awe as "Hello World!" printed out on the console and haven't looked back since! Ask any of my former collegues I'm known for being a mentor and providing guidance. If there was anything I wanted to be known for, it's the impact I can create on others by sharing my passion for coding!</p>

                            <p>Using Java I recreated Tic Tac Toe, the game has its own GUI that was created using JFrame, you click on the interface to place X on the grid. You play against an AI that places O's moves on the grid. The placing of the AI's moves is dependant on yours it can also detect winning moves for itself and favors those against defending. I find most users I have test the program ending up in a Tie or Loss!</p>
